It's just another Malware Database, y'know the drill, don't download this stuff unless you know what you're doing, the pass for the archives is at the bottom.
And if there's something from this Database you want removed, comment on the file.

# ERRORS
If you find an error in the archives, like a wrong password or corrupt, feel free to make an Issue in the Issues tab, but read the FAQ first before doing so, thanks!

# FAQ

1. Q: Why can't I open the archives?

   A: Probably because of the splitted zips. Firstly, download all the files in the folder and then open the **.001** file and then extract it with the password. If not that, the archive is broken, make an issue if so. Thanks.

Got anymore questions? Make an issue if so.
If you wanna suggest malware to add, make a merge or chat in the discussion or issues!
