Rover is a desktop assistant similar to the famous Bonzi Buddy, however this one provides more features such as GDI and system corruption. This assistant was created specially for malware lovers, basically for people who likes to run malwares.

So if you are curious about malwares and you want to know what this malware is capable of then this projects may suits your standards.

Of course try it out in the safe enviroment (virtual machine) rather than on your physical hardware. Keep in mind that this malware can damage system files and make the device unusable!

## What have been changed?

This is just a small update which brings more GDI effects, animations and some utilities. Features such as Games, Terminal, RoverNET2.0, RoverLOCK and RoverPAINT have not been finished yet, so they will not work if you try to access them.

### More GDI Effects ðŸŽ¨
## 

![](https://github.com/MalwareStudio/Rover-The-Desktop-Assistant/blob/main/Images/GDI%20MENU.png)

You can try out new GDI payloads such as Lighting, Brushes (Customizable), NoEscape, Mandela and also new GDI+ effects like Hue, Saturation, Contrast and Pixelate.

From this point, you can stop any GDI effects (applies only for animated ones) by typing (F5) and erase by typing (F6).

Did Rover say something mean to you? What if I told you that you can punish him? Yes, that's right! This update added the Slap feature, so if Rover make you angry you can teach him a lesson ðŸ˜ˆ

By the way, if you slap him 3 times, he will get very angry at you and he can even leave you! 

Of course, you can bring him back any time ðŸ˜Š

### Utilities (kind of useful)
## 

Rover does not only provides bad stuff. Now he can clean up the Temporary Files so-called Temp Files.

If your machine is full of these useless files, this tool can come in handy.

### Junk Cleaner (WPF)
## 

I have also created better version via WPF. 

This one provides even a Deep Scan, which can get rid of Temp Files from all drives within their subdirectories.

### RoverLOCK (WPF)
## 

Another external utility which could be embedded in the Rover.

This tool can protect any files via AES encryption.

## This project is open source!

I decided to publish the entire source code of the Rover Desktop Assistant.

Feel free to use this source code without any restrictions! However, I would be happy if you could mention me in the case of using code from this project ðŸ˜‡
