# ü§î What is Eel?
It is a small email worm I made. For entertainment purposes only!

# ‚ù§Ô∏è For skidders
I know that some people will skid some effects after I release Eel's source code to put in their malwares, and even if I complain about it, nothing will change...

So for that reason I added a GPLv3 license. In other words, if you use/modify a part of the code, you need to make your project open source and give ArTic (The guy that made the worm spread code) credit!
