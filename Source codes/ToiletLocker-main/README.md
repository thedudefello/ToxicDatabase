ToiletLocker. This is a joke virus, the main feature of which is a large number of hackers and toilets XD


**Main aspects:**


· When launched, it is copied to C:\Windows\INF with the name c_computeaccelerator.exe, as well as with the attributes hidden and system.

· Supports autorun in safe mode.

· The alt, win, tab, ctrl (and other) keys are blocked.

· The virus causes serious damage to the registry. The task manager, registry editor, cmd are prohibited, the start menu is empty, explorer.exe does not start when the system starts, but only the virus, access to the C drive is prohibited, all items in the ctrl alt del menu are missing, etc.

· The virus window is forced to be on top of other windows. Even if you launch, for example, process hacker and make it on top of other windows, the virus will still be on top of it.

· Unwanted processes for the virus are regularly closed (if any)

· The volume is constantly increased to 100%. Also the volume of music and its bass have been increased.

· When you press enter the input field is disabled and the timer is stopped, a progress bar will also appear, at the end of which (takes about 50 seconds) there will be a BSOD, and at reboot there will be a lot of loud GDI effects. But at the next reboot this will be removed, there will be no GDI effects. Also under the progress bar the text "deleting windows..." appears

· There is a 5-minute timer, at the end of which the same thing will happen as when you press enter

· Password: install2017mediagetforfree2013. If the password is written correctly, the timer is frozen, the input field is disabled, the registry is fixed, a progress bar appears (as when you press enter) and the text "deleting mediaget...". At the end of the progress bar, explorer starts and the virus completes its work.

· When you enter the correct password and press enter, the song changes
