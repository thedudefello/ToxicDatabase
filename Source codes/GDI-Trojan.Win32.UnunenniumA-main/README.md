# 🤔 What is UnunenniumA.exe?

UnunenniumA is a Trojan horse designed for Windows XP-11. It uses typedef NTSTATUS to crash the system. (not really it just shows that in the source) And its a short remaster to Ununennium by NotCCR. 

# ⚠️ Important!!!
This is a potentially harmful program that can cause your system's death & data loss. This software also displays flashing lights and plays loud sounds, so if you have a photosensitive disease like epilepsy, don't run this or watch any video about it for your security.

By running this program, you accept full responsibility for any damages that may occur. So, the creator (SBH a.k.a Stomachbughead) will not be responsible for anything caused by this software. By the way, this was created for educational and entertainment purposes, consequently, don't use it to do malicious acts like sharing with a friend.

# 🤔 What is the difference about Ununennium and UnunenniumA?

Ununennium (NotCCR) is destructive. His version contains system tools disabling. Destroying the MBR. etc..

UnunenniumA on the other hand doesn't disable system tools. Destroy the MBR and more. Its (kinda safe). So run at your own risk.

# 🤡 For Skidders!

Well, I have seen N17Pro3426 skidding my shaders from 6kals and zip. (shit malwares). and that makes me sad. So, a basic explaining, I made this trojan Open Source to make my subscribers look how it's made a GDI-Trojan and to make people learn GDI basics, NOT FOR SHIT17PRO3426!!!
